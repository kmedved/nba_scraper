# Agent Instructions

This repository must always maintain compatibility with both the **playbyplayv2** API data and the **CDN** API data.
The goal for any changes is to produce data that can be parsed and read by `kmedved/nba_parser`.

Agents must never guess about data structures or responses and must never use dummy or fabricated data.
